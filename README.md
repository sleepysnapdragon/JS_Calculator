# JS_Calculator

A calculator built in Javascript to match the [FCC calculator project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator/) spec

Passes all 16 supplied tests

## Suggested Developments
There are still some ways in which the Calculator could be improved
* At the moment when a user presses the decimal button with no digit before it, it is ignored.  Instead it could be intepreted as '0.'
* Could add another line to the display which shows the full calculation in progress (i.e. not just the most recent part)
* The calculator does not adjust for Javascript float point errors (e.g. 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3)
